## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://react.dev/)

### What I learned

This project provided valuable experience in:

- Integrating modern state management (Zustand) with robust form handling (React Hook Form).
- Implementing a multi-step form flow with step-by-step validation.
- Creating a fully responsive UI that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Strategically managing component state for complex forms.
- Debugging and correcting common React errors and complex layout issues across mobile and desktop.

### Continued development

I plan to continue exploring:

- More advanced animation and transition effects.
- Integration with a backend API for actual form submission.
- Accessibility improvements.
